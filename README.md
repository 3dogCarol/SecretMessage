This program takes as input a message.
python secretMsg.py "What a nice day"

It then creates two webpages; one for the original message and 
one for the scrambled version. The scrambled message is opened in a
web browser. One can click to see the original message.

The program requires the prank directory be in the same directory as 
the program.
